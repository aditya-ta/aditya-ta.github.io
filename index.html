										<h4>Audio Beam (Senior Year Design Project)</h4>
										<p>	
											
											This product is a <strong>portable guitar effects processor</strong> that uses inbuilt DSP functionalities in the MSP430 MCU. 
											I lead the software development in a team of four that successfully delivered this project. 
											It aimed to make the process of using an electric guitar more convenient. 
											The device is powered using a lithium ion battery and can be recharged. 
											The guitar can be hooked to the device via a traditional quarter inch jack (for analog input). 
											The device can be controlled wirelessly through an android phone using an application that we specifically made for this device. 
											This device has equalization, reverb, and distortion functionalities. 
											I developed and tested embedded software for the MCU-Codec interfacing using SPI and DMA (a work around for I2S that our MCU lacked). 
											I interfaced the BLE (Bluetooth Low energy) module(RN4020) to the MCU using UART and this enabled us to change the sound settings on the device. 
											Additionally, I collaborated in the testing and finetuning of digital filters.

										<h4>Polyphonic Keyboard Synthesizer</h4>
										<p> 
											I Lead the software development in a team of four that delivered a polyphonic keyboard synthesizer. 
											We used a keyboard just for the key (as input). 
											This keyboard used the MIDI protocol to send information about the keys being pressed to our STM32 MCU where we produced sound. 
											I devised embedded C programs that used efficient wave tables to produce the desired sound. 
											I followed optimal digital to analog conversion procedures to ensure accurate sound. 
											Furthermore, I collaborated in designing the PCB for this project.

										<h4>Roomba Mars Rover</h4>
										<p>
											Developed and successfully delivered a Roomba robot controlled by a TI MCU to emulate a Mars rover. 
											The goal of this project was to maneuver the robot into a goal tile in an obstacle course without line of sight. 
											Sonar and infrared sensors were employed to gauge distance and shape of the objects in the obstacle course. 
											These sensors were mounted on an apparatus that was rotated using a servo motor, this allowed us to scan more area by sweeping the sensors. 
											Additionally, the Roomba also included bumper and cliff sensors to aid the robot. 
											The movements of the robot were controlled using WIFI.

										<h4><a href="http://www.tadaproject.org/"><u>TADA (Technology Assited Dietary Assesment)</u></a></h4>
										<p>	
											This project aimed to translate photos taken on mobile phones to an accurate accout for caloric intake.
											I was part of a team that was guided by professor Edward J. Delp.
											I co-created an Android application that allows users to keep track of caloric intake by taking pictures of food. 
											I built an intuitive camera interface with an inbuilt angle detector so that the image processing team had optimal images to work with.
											Aditionally, I co-designed an improved UI that helped display results calculated by the image processing team.
