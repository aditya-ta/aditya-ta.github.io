									<p>
										I am an new undergraduate computer engineer from Purdue University (Main campus).
										I have a keen interest in technology and an endless appetite to learn new things about the same. 
										I am a result oriented individual who thrives in a team and finds it extremely rewarding to solve complex engineering problems.
										I have led software development in teams through key projects under a time sensitive environment. 
										My favorite pastime away from the desk is photography.

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<header>
										<h4>Audio Beam (Senior Year Design Project)</h4>
										<p>	
											
											This product is a <strong>portable guitar effects processor</strong> that uses inbuilt DSP functionalities in the MSP430 MCU. 
											I led the software development in a team of four that successfully delivered this project. 
											It aimed to make the process of using an electric guitar more convenient. 
											The device is powered using a lithium ion battery and can be recharged. 
											The guitar can be hooked to the device via a traditional quarter inch jack (for analog input). 
											The device can be controlled wirelessly through an android phone using an application that we specifically made for this device. 
											This device has equalization, reverb, and distortion functionalities. 
											I developed and tested embedded software for the MCU-Codec interfacing using SPI and DMA (a work around for I2S that our MCU lacked). 
											I interfaced the BLE (Bluetooth Low energy) module(RN4020) to the MCU using UART and this enabled us to change the sound settings on the device. 
											Additionally, I collaborated in the testing and finetuning of digital filters.

										<h4>Polyphonic Keyboard Synthesizer</h4>
										<p> 
											I Led the software development in a team of four that delivered a polyphonic keyboard synthesizer. 
											We used a keyboard just for the key (as input). 
											This keyboard used the MIDI protocol to send information about the keys being pressed to our STM32 MCU where we produced sound. 
											I devised embedded C programs that used efficient wave tables to produce the desired sound. 
											I followed optimal digital to analog conversion procedures to ensure accurate sound. 
											Furthermore, I collaborated in designing the PCB for this project.

										<h4>Roomba Mars Rover</h4>
										<p>
											Developed and successfully delivered a Roomba robot controlled by a TI MCU to emulate a Mars rover. 
											The goal of this project was to maneuver the robot into a goal tile in an obstacle course without line of sight. 
											Sonar and infrared sensors were employed to gauge distance and shape of the objects in the obstacle course. 
											These sensors were mounted on an apparatus that was rotated using a servo motor, this allowed us to scan more area by sweeping the sensors. 
											Additionally, the Roomba also included bumper and cliff sensors to aid the robot. 
											The movements of the robot were controlled using WIFI.

										<h4>Huffman Encoding and Decoding Algorithm using C</h4>
										<p>
											<strong>Encoding:</strong><br>
											Firstly, I calculated the frequency of each ascii character. 
											The reason for this would be to have shorter codes for characters that occur more. 
											I calculated the codes for each character by building a code book after constructing a strictly binary tree as shown in the figure below. 
											The characters are stored in leaf nodes (leaf node characters that have a higher frequency have a shorter height giving us shorter codes). 
											With this I was able to compress (in a lossless manner) "go go gophers" into just 37 bits. 
											I tested this implementation with files much longer than this. 
											For the compressed file, total number of characters in the compressed file, total number of unique characters and total number of characters in the original file were written. 
											Then the topology of the tree was written (used '0' and '1' to distinguish between leaf and non-leaf nodes), this would give us "001g1o001s1 001e1h01p1r" for the purposes of the example. 
											Finally printed the compressed data from the original file (by using the calculated codes for each character) at the end of the compressed file.
											
											<br>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/gogogophers_encoding.png"></span>

											<strong>Decoding:</strong><br>
											The tree topology in the compressed file was used to construct the binary tree. 
											A codebook was contructed using this tree and this allowed me to get back the original characters from the compressed data.

										<h4><a href="http://www.tadaproject.org/"><u>TADA (Technology Assited Dietary Assesment)</u></a></h4>
										<p>	
											This project aimed to translate photos taken on mobile phones to an accurate accout for caloric intake.
											I was part of a team that was guided by professor Edward J. Delp.
											I co-created an Android application that allows users to keep track of caloric intake by taking pictures of food. 
											I built an intuitive camera interface with an inbuilt angle detector so that the image processing team had optimal images to work with.
											Aditionally, I co-designed an improved UI that helped display results calculated by the image processing team.
